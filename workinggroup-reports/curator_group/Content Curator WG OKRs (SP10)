# Content Curator Lead OKRs
## Period under review: 24.05.2021-04.07.2021
Considered 3 criteria for evaluating OKRs:

- 3 periods:
  - For Scoring Period 8, **238 entities** were tested (videos and channels)
  - For Scoring Period 9, **507 entities** (videos and channels) were tested. **2.13** times more than in the previous period.
  - During Scoring Period 10, **943 entities** (videos and channels) were tested. **1.85** times more than in the previous period.
Each period the number of videos checked almost doubles.

- Number of unverified videos For Scoring Period 10 at the moment: **194**
Thus, the number of checked videos for the last Scoring Period 10 is 80%. Checking factor: **0.8.**
2 ineffective curators were fired.

- Also, as part of the reward, I propose to reward managers who find duplicates in hundreds of uploaded videos, including those verified by other curators: **Igrex (found 5 duplicates), lyazufey1812 (found 4 duplicates), meskalin (found 4 duplicates)**.
